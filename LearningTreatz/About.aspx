            People from all over the world attend Learning Tree courses at our public Education Centers.  Those attendees and the instructors who teach them are an invaluable resource for knowing what and 
            where to eat when attending a public Learning Tree course.

            This site is dedicated to sharing that knowledge so that we can all eat well while learning.
